#summary List of versions and changes

|| 2008-02-26 || 0.2 || Added visual file selector (resembles BufExplorer; also, some tricks were borrowed from source code of that really nice script). Autoload support and "write-plugin" guidelines (thanks to Thomas Link for advices). ||
|| 2008-02-19 || 0.1d || Now wildmenu is used as "engine", so look & feel are much better now. No more numeric shortcats, however. ||
|| 2008-02-18 || 0.1c || Default choice now mimics Alt-Tab (Cmd-Tab for Mac users), i.e. hitting the hot key and then <CR> will cycle between last two files. Visual adjustments: current file is square brakets, and asterisk indicates default choice. ||
|| 2008-02-18 || 0.1b || If selected file is already visible in some window, the script will activate it. ||
|| 2008-02-17 || 0.1a || When GUI is available, dialog forced to be console-friendly, i.e. no GUI  window is poping up. ||
|| 2008-02-16 || 0.1 || Initial release. ||
